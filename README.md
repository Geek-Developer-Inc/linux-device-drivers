### An introduction to linux device drivers [ Linux 设备驱动程序开发 ]

Linux device driver development, One of the many advantages of free operating systems, as typified by Linux, The Linux kernel remains a
large and complex body of code,This programming interface is such that drivers can be built separately from the rest of the kernel and "plugged in" at runtime when needed. This modularity makes Linux drivers easy to write.

Linux 设备驱动开发，以 linux 为代表的众多自由操作系统有着许多的优点，Linux 内核由大量复杂的代码组成，编程接口能够使得驱动程序独立于内核其它部分而建立，必要时可以在运行时“插入”到内核中，这种模块化的编程特点使得 Linux 驱动程序的编写更加简单。
